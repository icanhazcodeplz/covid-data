# covid-data

COVID-19 Hot-Spot Dashboard that shows the areas in the US that have the highest 
per capita cases. This project is, to say the least, a work in progress.
It is built using [Plotly Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) with data from 
[Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). 
The inspiration for the map is from the [NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html).

The dashboard is currently hosted on Google Cloud Platform, and is available at [www.covid19dashboard.app]().
